\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This report presents our replication of the Treasury-swap spread analysis from Siriwardane, Sunderam, and Wallen's "Segmented Arbitrage" paper. We detail our methodology for data collection, processing, and visualization, highlighting both our successes and challenges. We supplement our replication with additional analyses that enhance understanding of the underlying data patterns and provide further context to the segmented arbitrage phenomenon.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Treasury swap spreads represent the difference between the fixed rate on overnight indexed swaps and Treasury yields of corresponding maturities. These spreads serve as a key arbitrage measure in fixed income markets and play a central role in the "Segmented Arbitrage"\citet{NBERw30561} analysis. Our project replicates the Treasury swap spread visualizations while adding contextual analysis to better understand the underlying dynamics.

\section{Methodology and Data Sources}

\subsection{Data Sources}

All data for this project was sourced from Bloomberg using the xbbg Python package connected to a Bloomberg terminal. We extracted the following primary data series:

\begin{itemize}
    \item US Treasury yields across maturities (1Y, 2Y, 3Y, 5Y, 10Y, 20Y, 30Y)
    \item Overnight indexed swap (OIS) rates matching the same maturities
    \item Treasury-Eurodollar (TED) spread as a market-wide indicator of funding conditions
\end{itemize}

The data spans from January 2010 to the current date (\today), which includes the period examined in the original paper.

\subsection{Successes}

Our implementation achieved several key successes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Streamlined workflow}: We developed an end-to-end automated pipeline from data pulling through processing to visualization, with all components integrated into a single coherent project structure.
    
    \item \textbf{Efficient data processing}: Using pandas and NumPy, we calculated the Treasury swap spreads and implemented the necessary transformations to match the original paper's methodology.
    
    \item \textbf{Reproducible analysis}: Our implementation allows for easy updates with new data and straightforward modification of parameters, enhancing reproducibility.
    
    \item \textbf{Template implementation}: We successfully adapted the project template to accommodate the specific requirements of this analysis, maintaining a consistent structure.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Challenges}

We encountered several challenges during the replication process:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data availability}: Bloomberg data for 20-year Treasury yields was not available for the full range of dates in the original paper, particularly before 2020. This gap means that the replicated figure is not exactly replicated as in the paper.
    
    \item \textbf{Methodology alignment}: While the paper described its methodology for calculating the spreads, some implementation details required careful interpretation to ensure our calculations matched those in the original research.
    
    \item \textbf{Testing}: While trying to test the different functions through unit tests, we encountered a few errors which then required careful revision of the code.
\end{itemize}

\section{Treasury Swap Spread Analysis}

\subsection{Replication Results}

% Replication of the paper plot

    \caption{Treasury swap spreads from January 2010 to \today approximating the plot in the paper.}
    \label{fig:treasury_swap_spreads_replicated}
\end{figure}

Our replication of the Treasury swap spreads from the original paper shows the time series of spreads across different maturities, highlighting the persistent nature of these arbitrage opportunities over time. The visualization demonstrates significant variation both across maturities and over time. Notably, longer-term spreads (20Y and 30Y) display consistently higher values than shorter-term spreads, suggesting structural differences in arbitrage opportunities across the yield curve. 

\subsection{Updated Plot}
% Updated plot
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{updated_swap_spread_arb_figure.png}
    \caption{Updated plot with data from January 2010 to \today.}
    \label{fig:treasury_swap_spreads_updated}
\end{figure}

In these plots, a few assumptions lead to the conclusion that arbitrage opportunities are present. For context, the arbitrage opportunity presents itsefl as follows. If the treasury yield is higher than the swap rate, an investor may repo a treasury, thus receiving a high fixed rate and paying the overnight repo rate. Simultaneously, this investor would enter a swap in which they pay fixed and receive the floating overnight interest rate. Hence, the assumption is that the investor would get to pocket the difference in rates between the treasury yield and the swap rate, while the overnight floating rates would net each other out. As such, anywhere that the treasury yield is higher than the swap rate (which is represented by a negative spread in the figures above) is an arbitrage. It is important to acknowledge that this is only the case if the repo rate on the treasury is not significantly larger than the floating rate on the swap. The author of the paper addresses this with the assumption that since a repo is securitized, it is safe to assume that the floating rate the investor pays will not exceed the floating rate they receive \citet{NBERw30561}.

\subsection{Supplementary Analysis}

    \caption{Each number represents the mean spread between the swap rate and the treasury. This figure being negative represents the presense of an arbitrage opportunity as discussed.}
\end{table}

% Plot containing 1Y Treasury and swap

    \caption{Variation in treasury(1Y) and swap yields over time from January 2010 to \today.}
    \label{fig:treasury_swap_spreads_supplementary1}
\end{figure}

% Plot containing 30Y Treasury and swap
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{replication_figure30.png}
    \caption{Variation in treasury(1Y) and swap yields over time from January 2010 to \today.}
    \label{fig:treasury_swap_spreads_supplementary30}
\end{figure}

The two supplementary figures show the yields and swap rates for securities with a 1 year and 30 year tenor, respectively, across the last 15 years. With the assumptions made in the paper that the treasury repo rate will be lower than the floating rate in the swap, anywhere that the treasury yield exceeds the swap rate represents a point when holding the treasury super replicates receiving fixed in a swap of the same tenor \citet{NBERw30561}. Especially for the 30 year figure, these replicating portfolios have a large divergence from one another, with the treasury yield exceeding the swap rate for a significant time period, implying arbitrage opportunities.

\section{Discussion of Findings}

Our replication and supplementary analyses support the key findings from the original paper regarding segmentation in arbitrage markets. The Treasury swap spread data exhibits several notable characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Persistent arbitrage opportunities}: The consistently non-zero spreads, particularly for longer maturities, indicate persistent arbitrage opportunities that are not quickly eliminated by market participants.
    
    \item \textbf{Term structure patterns}: The increasing magnitude of spreads with maturity suggests structural differences in arbitrage conditions across the yield curve.
    
    \item \textbf{Temporal variation}: Significant time variation in spreads, including episodic spikes, suggests the influence of broader market conditions on arbitrage opportunities.
\end{itemize}

These findings align with the paper's argument that arbitrage markets are more segmented than traditionally assumed, with both funding and balance sheet constraints playing roles in creating and maintaining these segmentations.

\section{Conclusion}

Our replication of the Treasury swap spread analysis provides support for the segmented arbitrage hypothesis. The automated pipeline we developed enables efficient data processing and visualization, while our supplementary analyses offer additional context and insight into the underlying patterns.

The challenges we encountered, particularly related to data availability, highlight the importance of careful consideration of data limitations when interpreting financial research. Despite these challenges, our analysis successfully captures the key patterns observed in the original paper and provides a foundation for further exploration of arbitrage dynamics in fixed income markets.
