    "Treasury Swap arbitrage measures the difference between the fixed rate on overnight indexed swaps (OIS) and Treasury yields of matching maturities. This spread captures violations of the law of one price in fixed income markets. As the paper shows, these arbitrage opportunities persist due to funding and balance sheet segmentation among financial intermediaries."

    "The core logic of this arbitrage opportunity is that when the treasury yield and the swap rates are the same at identical tenors, holding the treasury on a repo super replicates receiving fixed in the swap. This is because the securitized floating repo rate is assumed to be less than the floating rate paid in a swap. Hence, if one were to hold a treasury on repo and pay fixed in a swap when the treasury yields exceeded the swap rates, they would be receiving a higher fixed rate than they are paying, and would receive a higher floating rate than they are paying also, implying an arbitrage."

    "Now that we have the data, we calculate the arbitrage spread. The assumption here is that if this value goes negative, then this is an arb. We pay fixed in the swap agreement and receive the floating rate. Then, we purchase a treasury on repo, meaning that we are receiving the treasury rate and paying a floating repo rate. Thus, we get paid T_rate - Swap_rate + Swap_floating - Repo_Floating. Hence, this is not a true arbitrage unless you are guaranteed that you can secure 3mo treasury repos at a lower floating rate than you would receive in the swap (most likely SOFR)."
